    "A differential amplifier takes two small inputs, and finds the delta between them. This is a set up where $Vin(-)$ will move against the output and $Vin(+)$ will move with the output.  How does this work? \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the voltage drop across $Re$ will never change by a significant amount. The voltage at the emitters of the transistors are roughly a voltage drop from the small inputs. Therefore the voltage before the resistors hovers within a few mV of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the voltage drop does not change, there is a fixed amount of current that goes through the $latex Re$ resistor. Which must be a sum of the current that exits the emitters. Therefore the currents through the collectors must be inverse to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now say that the current through $Vin(+)$ increases. The current through $Q2$ must fall. Therefore $Vout$ must fall, as the resistor above $Vout$ causes change in current to change with voltage. If $Vin(-)$ increases, then again, the resistor will cause $Vout$ to change as well. "
