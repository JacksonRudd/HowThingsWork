# How Do Lemon Batteries work

Gasoline is to a car engine as an electropositive metal is to a battery. An electropositive metal is one that is anxious to give away electrons. Zinc is an example of an electropositive metal, and in a copper, zinc, lemon battery, the energy is coming from the zinc. How does the zinc power this battery? 

Say that we had a plate of copper and a plate of zinc. Copper is much more electronegative then  zinc, and therefore the copper will immediately steal some of the zinc's electrons.

How can we make use of these moving electrons? Instead of touching the copper directly to the zinc, this time we will connect them with a wire. This time the electrons must cross the wire to get from the zinc to the copper. Now we have created a current. 

This current will be short lived: once a few electrons move from zinc to copper, the copper will become increasingly negatively charged, which will stop the new electrons from flowing over the wire. Also the zinc will become increasingly positively charged, which will have the same effect. 

For the copper to maintain its charge, it needs to have a place to put all of its extra electrons. For zinc to maintain its charge, it needs a place to get rid of its newly created zinc ions.  

This is where the lemon juice enters. The lemon juice is an electrolyte, which means that there are many positive and negative ions floating around in the lemon juice. You can think of it as a substance that "dissolves" and provides ions. The lemon juice will dissolve the zinc ions and provide the copper with positive ions which will pair off with coppers extra electrons. 

Lemon juice is a strong electrolyte because acids tend to make strong electrolytes. An acid is of course a proton donor. A proton is simply a positive ion. The conjugate base will function as a negative ion. 

 When the battery is running. The extra electrons in the copper will be given to hydrogen ions from vitamin C. The hydrogen will then bubble from the coppers surface. The zinc plate will loose mass as the positive zinc will pair with the conjugate acid of vitamin C. 

 As the hydrogen bubbles away and the zinc looses mass, the battery will lose it's charge.  

 All batteries use the same formula, an electrolyte, an electropositive metal, and a comparatively electronegative metal.
